## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### OpenServ Agent Collaboration

CryptoVerifier orchestrates multiple specialized agents:

1. **Main Coordinator**: CryptoVerifierAgent (Agent #280)
2. **URL Analysis**: 
   - Brave Search Assistant (Agent #171)
   - Webpage Content Reader (Agent #172)
3. **Deep Research**: EXA Agent (Agent #386)
4. **Token Analysis**: ETH Wallet Scanner (Agent #167)
5. **Data Processing**: JSON Parser (Agent #65)
6. **Report Generation**: Copywriter (Agent #41)

### Sequential Task Workflows

Each analysis request follows a specific workflow with multiple stages:

1. **Content Retrieval**: Safely fetching data about the URL/token/message
2. **Primary Analysis**: Identifying basic security indicators
3. **Deep Analysis**: Researching reputation and security history
4. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Combining all findings into a risk evaluation
5. **Report Generation**: Creating a user-friendly security report
6. **Delivery**: Sending the formatted report to the user via Telegram

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Telegram Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot
- `/help` - Display help information
- `/check [content]` - Analyze a URL, token address, or message
- `/history` - View your analysis history

### Example Usages

#### URL Check
```
/check https://example-crypto-site.com
```

#### Token Analysis
```
/check 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e
```

#### Message Analysis
